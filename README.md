Image Processing, Digital Geometry and Computational Geometry Course
====================================================================

This material corresponds to a course on elementary image processing, digital geometry and computational geometry. In French, it corresponds to the lecture "Images Numériques et Géométrie Discrète" at the ENS-Lyon (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon) and Univesité Claude Bernard Lyon 1.

First slides are in French but most of them are in English. The content is "work in progress" and is updated continously. As a consequence, it may contain errors. If you found ones, please contact the author or create a <a href="https://github.com/dcoeurjo/lectureDG/issues/new">github issue</a>.
